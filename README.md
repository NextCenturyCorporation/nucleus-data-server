# Neon Server

The Neon Server is a REST server that is used with the [Neon Middleware](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/neon-framework) to provide datastore adapters, run datastore queries, transform query results, and perform data processing.  The [Neon Dashboard](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/neon-dash-internal) is a UI that interacts with the Neon Server.

## Technical Stack

The Neon Server is a Spring Boot WebFlux Java application built using Gradle plugins.

### Modules

The application is built using multiple custom modules:

* The **server** module contains the core Neon Server code.
* The **esadapter** module contains the Elasticsearch REST datastore adapter.
* The **common** module contains the common adapter and model classes.

Change the modules included in your build (to add or remove adapter dependencies) by editing the [gradle.properties](./gradle.properties) and [settings.gradle](./settings.gradle) files.
